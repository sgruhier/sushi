Sushi Bill mobile web application
=================================

## Introduction

This mobile web application went from a personal story. With my wife and my daugthers, we went to a Kaiten-zushi restaurant (From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi): Kaiten-zushi is a sushi restaurant where the plates with the sushi are placed on a rotating conveyor belt that winds through the restaurant and moves past every table and counter seat)

We had a lot of fun but the bill was pretty high :). So I said, we should have a iPhone application for that! So I decided to do it. Instead of developing a native app, I take the opportunity to go deeper in how to make a web application that looks like a real native application like [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/) or [Financial Times](http://apps.ft.com/).

I wanted to make it as clean as I can. This was also an opportunity to use in the same project Backbone, Zepto and BrunchWithCoffee.
That's it, now you can manage your sushi bill easily.

## Technical details

Later on a blog post 

## Components

This is demo application of a mobile web application made with

* [BrunchWithCoffee](http://brunchwithcoffee.com/)
* [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
* [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/)
* and two small JS component of [MATTEO SPINELLI](http://cubiq.org/): 
  [iScroll 4](http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) and [Add to home screen](http://cubiq.org/add-to-home-screen)

## Prerequisite

To be able to play with the code you node to install

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [BrunchWithCoffee](http://brunchwithcoffee.com/)

But this is only if you want to rebuild the code. It's a static web (yes, I swear it is!) so you can just copy the build directory and open index.html to run it locally
