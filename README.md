Sushi Bill mobile web application
=================================

This is demo application of a mobile web application made with
* [BrunchWithCoffee](http://brunchwithcoffee.com/)
* [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
* [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/)
* and two small JS component of [MATTEO SPINELLI](http://cubiq.org/): 
  [iScroll 4](http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4) and [Add to home screen](http://cubiq.org/add-to-home-screen)

## Prerequisite

To be able to play with the code you node to install

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [BrunchWithCoffee](http://brunchwithcoffee.com/)

But this is only if you want to rebuild the code. It's a static web (yes, I swear it is!) so you can just copy the build directory and open index.html to run it locally
